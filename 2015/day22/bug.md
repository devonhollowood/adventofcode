I'm going back and finishing 2015's puzzles, which I never got around to doing a year ago. I'm on Day 22, and I think I have found a solution which is correct, but the solution page says my answer is too low. The boss in my puzzle has 55 hp and 5 damage. My solution is:

    Poison (173 mana)
    Recharge (229 mana)
    Shield (113 mana)
    Poison (173 mana)
    Magic Missile (53 mana)
    Recharge (229 mana)
    Poison (173 mana)
    Drain (73 mana)
    Magic Missile (53 mana)
    ---
    Total cost: 1269 mana

The battle goes as follows:

    Player: Hp: 50; Mana: 500; Armor: 0
    Boss: Hp: 55
    -> Player casts Poison
    -> Poison does 3 damage to boss
    Player: Hp: 50; Mana: 327; Armor: 0
    Boss: Hp: 52
    -> Boss does 8 damage to player

    -> Hard mode does 1 damage to player
    -> Poison does 3 damage to boss (5 ticks left)
    Player: Hp: 41; Mana: 327; Armor: 0
    Boss: Hp: 49
    -> Player casts Recharge
    -> Poison does 3 damage to boss (4 ticks left)
    -> Recharge gives player 101 mana (5 ticks left)
